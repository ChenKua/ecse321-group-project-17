# ECSE321 Project Group 17

Group 17 is part of Development Unit 2, and we are working on the Co-op Administrator viewpoint. A detailed breakdown of our system features can be found in our system requirements, as well as on the Wiki.

## Links

Our frontend Heroku application can be accessed [here](https://ecse321-group17-frontend.herokuapp.com/#/).

Our backend Heroku application can be accessed [here](https://ecse321-group17.herokuapp.com/).

## Run Locally

To run the frontend locally, clone this repository and run `npm start` from within the Frontend folder.

The backend can be run locally with the Spring Tools Suite application. If the Gmail API imports cannot be resolved, running `gradle eclipse` in the backend folder should fix that issue.
